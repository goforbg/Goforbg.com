## Core lesson
Put yourself in situations where failure isn’t an option.

## Sales
Sales remains, by far, the most important skill to learn.  
Everything else compounds on top of it.

## How wealth actually works
Wealth only comes from volume, iteration, leverage, and arbitrage.  
There is no other formula that scales.

Ask yourself honestly:

Do you have a leveraged or arbitraged package of skills that can be promised and fulfilled **without time being the input**, at scale, that people anywhere in the world find valuable — in terms of time, money, or emotion?

If time is a required input, wealth will always be capped.  
Time-based effort does not compound.

## The internal blockers
Most of the past exists only in your head.  
Shame. Trauma. Ego.

Can you move past these, or will they quietly run your life?

## Direction and inversion
Do you have a strong why?

Can you do inversion thinking — what happens if you don’t do the thing?

## Knowing what it actually takes
Do you actually know:

- What actions are required  
- At what volume  
- For how long  
- With what level of mental toughness, patience, network, and luck  

To get what you want?

## The fundamentals
Most of life comes down to a few fundamentals:

- **Health:** eating well, working out, energy management  
- **Money skills:** leveraged, rare skills that others can’t easily do  
- **Social skills:** relationships, partner, kids, parents  
- **Community:** taking care of people who work with and for you  

## What worked for me
My own success came from two things:

- **Communication infrastructure:** volume of emails, posts, outreach  
- **Quality and depth of content:** learning from people who’ve done it (long-form thinking, not shortcuts)  

## Meta-skills that matter
- Communication  
- Recruitment  
- Objection handling  
- Tolerance  

## Mental skills that matter
- Tolerance  
- Resilience  
- Fortitude  
- Adaptability

## Perspective
Sales and life are mostly about asking one question in hard moments:  
**How would a hero react here?**

## Money and credit
Most of what we call “money” is actually credit — trust borrowed from the future.

## Adversity
You probably wouldn’t want big things if you hadn’t grown up with adversity.  
Hard beginnings create unreasonable ambition.

## How to approach any goal
Before chasing any goal:

- Observe  
- Write down parameters  
- Write down the volume required  
- Estimate the odds  
- Define what failure costs  
- Define the cost of each iteration  

Then execute.

## Volume
Volume negates luck.

## Capital and systems
Capital, resources (stock, employees, assets), time, and value (trust, reliability) all move together — carried by capitalism, influenced by government policy.

## When things don't work
If something isn’t working:

- Do more  
- Do better  
- Or do something else  

## Benchmarks and judgment
You need someone you look up to. Benchmarks matter.

People will judge you whether you like it or not.  
You might as well make a good impression.

## Competition
In the long run, companies often win together, even while competing.

## Risk
Life is a poker game.  
No outcome is guaranteed. You still have to place bets.  
Sometimes you walk away with a loss.

## Emotional discipline
You can’t afford to care about everything.  
That’s okay.

## The four pillars
Win across four pillars:

- Making money  
- Health and fitness  
- Family, relationships, community  
- Hobbies — so you don’t lose your mind  

## Finance, simply
Most finance is simple at its core: lending, borrowing, or owning a piece of something — now or in the future — based on real value or informed bets.

## Endurance
Suffering now is almost always cheaper than suffering later.

Endurance makes everything make sense in hindsight.

## Environment and benchmarks
Environment and people you hang out with insanely decide your benchmarks and how hard you need to try in order to succeed.
